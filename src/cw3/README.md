**CW3: Video Segmentation**
A colour histogram h(.) can be generated by counting how many times each colour occurs in an image.
Histogram intersection can be used to match a pair of histograms. Given a pair of histograms, e.g., of an
input image I and a model M, each containing n bins, the intersection of the histograms is defined as
âˆ‘ min(h(Ij),h(Mj)) n
 j=1 .

a. Write a histogram function that returns the colour histogram of an input image. Visualize the histogram
and save the corresponding figure. For a given video sequence, use the above function to construct
the histogram of each frame.

b. Write a function that returns the value of the intersection of a pair of histograms. For a given video
sequence, use the histogram intersection function to calculate the intersection between consecutive
frames (e.g. between It and It+1, between It+1 and It+2 and so on). Find how to normalize the
intersection. Does that change the results? Plot the intersection values over time and the normalised
intersection values, and save the corresponding figures. Show and comment the figures in the report.

c. Discuss in the report the following: What does the intersection value represent for a given input video?
Can you use it to make a decision about scene changes? How robust to changes in the video is the
histogram intersection? When does it fail?
